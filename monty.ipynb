    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid ambiguities, we have to make some assumptions about the behavior of the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The host never opens the door you picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The host never opens the door with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you choose the door with the car, the host chooses one of the other doors at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The host always offers you the option to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, are you better off sticking or switching?\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is that you are better off switching.  If you stick, you win 1/3 of the time.  If you switch, you win 2/3 of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one of many arguments that might persuade you.\n",
    "\n",

    "> If you always switch, you win if you did _not_ choose the door with the car, so the probability is 2/3.\n",
