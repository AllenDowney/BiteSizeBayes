    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes a computational approach to understanding probability.  We'll use data from the General Social Survey to compute the probability of propositions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If I choose a random survey respondent, what is the probability they are female?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If I choose a random survey respondent, what is the probability they work in banking?\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we will explore two related concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conjunction, which is the probability that two propositions are both true; for example, what is the probability of choosing a female banker?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conditional probability, which is the probability that one proposition is true, given that another is true; for example, given than a respondent is female, what is the probability that she is a banker?\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose these examples because they are related to a famous experiment by Tversky and Kahneman, who posed the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.  Which is more probable?\n",
    "1. Linda is a bank teller.\n",
    "2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people choose the second answer, presumably because it seems more consistent with the description.  It seems unlikely that Linda would be *just* a bank teller; if she is a bank teller, it seems likely that she would also be a feminist.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the second answer cannot be \"more probable\", as the question asks.  Suppose we find 1000 people who fit Linda's description and 10 of them work as bank tellers.  How many of them are also feminists?  At most, all 10 of them are; in that case, the two options are *equally* likely.  More likely, only some of them are; in that case the second option is *less* likely.  But there can't be more than 10 out of 10, so the second option cannot be more likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error people make if they choose the second option is called the [conjunction fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy).   It's called a [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) because it's a logical error and \"conjunction\" because \"bank teller AND feminist\" is a [logical conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction).\n",
    "\n",
    "If this example makes you uncomfortable, you are in good company.  The biologist [Stephen J. Gould wrote](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.1989.10554932) :\n",
    "\n",
    "> I am particularly fond of this example because I know that the [second] statement is least probable, yet a little [homunculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus_argument) in my head continues to jump up and down, shouting at me, \"but she can't just be a bank teller; read the description.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "## Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I should define probability, but that [turns out to be surprisingly difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations).  To avoid getting bogged down before we get started, I'll start with a simple definition: a **probability** is a **fraction** of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we survey 1000 people, and 20 of them are bank tellers, the fraction that work as bank tellers is 0.02 or 2\\%.  If we choose a person from this population at random, the probability that they are a bank teller is 2\\%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(By \"at random\" I mean that every person in the dataset has the same chance of being chosen, and by \"they\" I mean the [singular, gender-neutral pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they), which is a correct and useful feature of English.)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this definition and an appropriate dataset, we can compute probabilities by counting.\n",
    "\n",
