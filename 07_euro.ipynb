    "getting a result as extreme as that would be less than 7%’.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But [asks MacKay] do these data give evidence that the coin is biased rather than fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we have to make some modeling choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's assume that if you spin a coin on edge, there is some probability that it will land heads up.  I'll call that probability $x$.\n",
