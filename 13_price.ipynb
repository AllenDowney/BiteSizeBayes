    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "[In a previous notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/BiteSizeBayes/blob/master/09_predict.ipynb) we used the time between goals to update our estimate of the goal-scoring rate of a soccer team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption that goal-scoring is well-modeled by a Poisson process, the time between goals follows an [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the goal-scoring rate is λ, the probability of seeing an interval between goals of $t$ is proportional to the PDF of the exponential distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t; λ) = λ~\\exp(-λ t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $t$ is a continuous quantity, the value of this expression is not really a probability; technically it is a [probability density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function).  However, it is proportional to the probability of the data, so we can use it as a likelihood in a Bayesian update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the PDF of a normal distribution the same way, in order to estimate the value of prizes on a game show.\n",
    "Once we compute a posterior distribution, we'll use it to optimize a decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the real power of Bayesian methods, not just computing posterior distributions, but using them to make better decisions."

    "On November 1, 2007, contestants named Letia and Nathaniel appeared on *The Price is Right*, an American game show. They competed in a game called \"The Showcase\", where the objective is to guess the price of a collection of prizes. The contestant who comes closest to the actual price, without going over, wins the prizes.\n",
