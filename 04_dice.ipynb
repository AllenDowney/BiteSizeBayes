    "\n",
    "And applied it to the case where we use data, $D$, to update the probability of a hypothesis, $H$.  In this context, we write Bayes's Theorem like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(H|D) = P(H) ~ P(D|H) ~/~ P(D)$\n",
    "\n",
    "And give each term a name:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P(H)$ is the \"prior probability\" of the hypothesis, which represents how confident you are that $H$ is true prior to seeing the data,\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P(D|H)$ is the \"likelihood\" of the data, which is the probability of seeing $D$ if the hypothesis is true,\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P(D)$ is the \"total probability of the data\", that is, the chance of seeing $D$ regardless of whether $H$ is true or not.\n",

    "## Why does this work?\n",

    "1. First, I'll show that it makes sense to normalize the posteriors so they add up to 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's the first argument.  Let's start with Bayes's Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(H|D) = P(H) ~ P(D|H)~/~P(D)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the denominator, $P(D)$, does not depend on $H$, so it is the same for all hypotheses.  If we factor it out, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(H|D) \\sim P(H) ~ P(D|H)$\n",

    "\n",
    "* Collectively exhaustive, that is, at least one of them must be true.\n",
